#### Project description:
This is sample project which shows how to create executable binaries out of NodeJs source for (Windows, MAC, Linux, etc).
Check out [Pkg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg) for documentation.

##### Why do we need binaries ?
* No need to install dependencies for OS (NodeJs)
* Quick demos
* For testing by QA's for example (no need for complicated installation)

##### Other:
* **create_binary.sh** script for generating binaries
* external config capability - by default once binaries generated config files are locked within
